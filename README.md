# Topic Of the Day BOT

This is a simple Reddit bot that submits a post to a subreddit every day.

The bot reads topics from a CSV file and every 24 hours submits a new one to the subreddit configured with the configured flair.

All of the configuration is done via the praw.ini file.

The topic CSV file text should be in Reddit compliant markdown.
